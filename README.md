# Selleris Public Customer Documentation

This repository contains public, customer‑facing documentation for Selleris in English. It provides clear, versioned information about how we work with clients: cooperation terms, processes, service expectations, and supporting guides.

## Contents (Initial Skeleton)
- `docs/cooperation-terms.md` – Core framework of cooperation terms (engagement models, responsibilities, IP, confidentiality, etc.)

Additional documents (pricing guides, SLAs, security whitepaper, onboarding checklist, API references) will be added progressively.

## Goals
- Transparency: Make key terms and collaboration principles visible early.
- Consistency: Single source of truth for client‑facing policies.
- Versioning: Track revisions with clear change history.
- Extensibility: Easy to add new topic-focused documents under `docs/`.

## How to Use (For Internal Maintainers)
1. Propose changes via pull request (PR) with a concise summary and rationale.
2. Update the Revision History section in the modified document.
3. Use semantic commit messages (e.g., `docs: clarify acceptance criteria`).
4. Keep documents in English; add localized variants later under a `i18n/` folder if needed.
